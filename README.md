## About me<br>

Bonjour, Iâ€™m Emma, a senior who majoring in Management Information System in National Central University.
To step outside my comfort zone, I studied French skill as a exchange student in Lyon, France, for a half year.
During undergraduate study, I spent a lot of time developing website, becoming a self-control and high-demanded person. Present, I have started to learn backend in express and python.
